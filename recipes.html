            <ol>
                <li>1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Instructions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes until well combined.</li>
                <li>Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.</li>
                <li>Once cooled, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or frost it with your favorite icing.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve! Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate cake.</li>
